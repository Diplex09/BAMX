# iOS mobile application developed for BAMX (Banco de Alimentos de México)
Repository for the TC2007B subject of the ITC study plan at the Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara. This repository contains all the documentation related to the BAMX's project done during the course. The project was a mobile application developed in Swift for iOS that allows people all around Mexico to donate both in kind and in cash. It also allows the BAMX staff to upload news, events or donation goals in the feed section.

### My contribution - Full-stack dev: Aldo Alejandro Degollado Padilla
